workflows across voice, text, and connected systems.

We're hiring a Senior Engineer to architect and build the core runtime powering
voice-first, autonomous agents.

- Multi-step task planning and execution (plan, act, verify, recover)
- Tool routing and workflow state machines
- Deterministic + LLM hybrid control loops
- Context management and long-lived memory
- Guardrails for safe, reliable autonomy

Voice-First Agent Systems:
- Streaming speech-to-agent pipelines
- Interruptibility and conversational continuation
- Sub-500ms agent response loops
- LiveKit / WebRTC-based realtime infrastructure
- Voice AI integrations (STT, TTS, turn detection, VAD)

Requirements:
- 5+ years backend engineering experience
- Strong Python and/or Go
- Experience building agentic AI workflows
- Familiarity with LLM tool calling and structured outputs
- Experience with real-time systems and WebRTC
- Strong product judgment

Preferred:
- Experience with LiveKit or similar WebRTC platforms
